# LDD3

Yes, it is exactly what you think: another charting library based on [d3](https://d3js.org).

This one was built using [d3](https://d3js.org) v4 and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).

This is currently work in progress (like, really), but I hope some people can find it useful, to see how d3 and typescript can be used, or simply just want to throw some charts on a page without having to deal with the whoe d3 stack.

## Library structure
The library currently comprises two types of controls:
* axes
* charts

## Available axes
### BottomCategoricalAxis
### BottomLinearAxis
### LeftCategoricalAxis
### LeftLinearAxis
### TopLinearAxis

## Available charts
### LinearLinearChart
### HorizontalBarChart
